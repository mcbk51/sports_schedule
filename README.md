This CLI application offers a streamlined way to view daily schedules for major U.S. sports leagues.

It displays all games for a specified date directly in the terminal. If a game is in progress, the current score is shown along with its status. The app also indicates if a game has been delayed or has already finished.
You can view schedules for any past or present or future date.
